description: I prefer to have up-to-date software on my devices, or security reasons and just for enjoying the latest features as well. Aftermarket software support of Android device manufacturers aren't up to par with Apple's, I must concede. I do not however want to spend a fortune on features I can get for a more modest price. The solution is simple (not really). I scoured the internet and taught myself how to install custom ROMs created by honorable devs of the vast internet.
