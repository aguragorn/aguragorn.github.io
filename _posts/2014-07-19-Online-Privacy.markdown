description: I value my freedom. I try to avoid putting so much information out there, which will definitely be used without my interest in mind. Our data should belong to us not to anyone else. Here's some alternatives I've found. Email - Proton Mail, Criptext. Cloud Storage - Nextcloud. Password Manager - Keepass, Bitwarden. 2FA - Authy. Search Engine - duckduckgo.com. Browser - Firefox with DoH enabled (TOR Browser if you want go further).
