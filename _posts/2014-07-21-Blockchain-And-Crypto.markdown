description: I have dipped my toes into cryptocurrency trading since 2017 and been reading about new blockchain projects. The new approach to software that blockchain brings fascinates and excites me. Truly owning digital assets used in games you play, enabling owners to re-sell assets we paid for just like it physically exists. Developers are now getting creative, who knows where else it will be used, and I want to be a part of this revolution.
